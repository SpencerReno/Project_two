## Machine Learning Models
Graph 1: For this graph the highest score is the best so in this case the random forest model had the highest testing r2 score.

For the next 3 graphs the lowest score is the best since you are looking for the least amount of error. There is a consistant trend
with in all three graphs that KNN is the highest and Random Forest is the lowest. With this being said its clear that the best model 
of the three is the Random Forest model based on all these scores.
